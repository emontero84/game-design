1. Infestation: This phase involves the initial presence or influence of the demonic entity.
Signs of infestation may include strange occurrences, unexplained phenomena, or a sense of
foreboding in a location or individual.
2. Oppression: In this phase, the demonic entity starts exerting its influence on the individual.
The person may experience physical, psychological, or spiritual distress, such as nightmares,
mood swings, personality changes, or unexplained illnesses.
3. External Manifestation: The demonic entity begins to manifest itself outwardly, often through the
possessed person's behavior or physical appearance. This can include speaking in strange voices,
exhibiting abnormal strength, or displaying knowledge beyond their natural capabilities.
4. Control: The demonic entity gains significant control over the individual's actions and faculties.
The possessed person may lose autonomy and become a vessel for the demon's intentions and
desires. This can involve violent or self-destructive behavior, speaking in tongues, or engaging in
blasphemous acts.
5. Exorcism: The final phase involves the attempt to rid the individual of the demonic presence
through an exorcism ritual. This process typically includes religious prayers, sacred objects, and
the intervention of a trained exorcist or religious authority. The goal is to expel the demon and
restore the person to their normal state.
